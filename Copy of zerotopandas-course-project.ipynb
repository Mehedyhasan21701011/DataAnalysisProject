You will pick a real-world dataset of your choice and apply the concepts learned in this course to perform exploratory data analysis. Use this starter notebook as an outline for your project . Focus on documentation and presentation - this Jupyter notebook will also serve as a project report, so make sure to include detailed explanations wherever possible using Markdown cells.\n","\n","### Evaluation Criteria\n","\n","Your submission will be evaluated using the following criteria:\n","\n","* Dataset must contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows of data\n","* You must ask and answer at least 4 questions about the dataset\n","* Your submission must include at least 4 visualizations (graphs)\n","* Your submission must include explanations using markdown cells, apart from the code.\n","* Your work must not be plagiarized i.e. copy-pasted for somewhere else.\n","\n","\n","Follow this step-by-step guide to work on your project.\n","\n","\n","### Step 1: Select a real-world dataset\n","\n","- Find an interesting dataset on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?fileType=csv\n","- The data should be in CSV format, and should contain at least 3 columns and 150 rows\n","- Download the dataset using the [`opendatasets` Python library](https://github.com/JovianML/opendatasets#opendatasets)\n","\n","Here's some sample code for downloading the [US Elections Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset):\n","\n","```\n","import opendatasets as od\n","dataset_url = 'https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset'\n","od.download('https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/us-elections-dataset')\n","```\n","\n","You can find a list of recommended datasets here: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/recommended-datasets-for-course-project/11711\n","\n","### Step 2: Perform data preparation & cleaning\n","\n","- Load the dataset into a data frame using Pandas\n","- Explore the number of rows & columns, ranges of values etc.\n","- Handle missing, incorrect and invalid data\n","- Perform any additional steps (parsing dates, creating additional columns, merging multiple dataset etc.)\n","\n","\n","### Step 3: Perform exploratory analysis & visualization\n","\n","- Compute the mean, sum, range and other interesting statistics for numeric columns\n","- Explore distributions of numeric columns using histograms etc.\n","- Explore relationship between columns using scatter plots, bar charts etc.\n","- Make a note of interesting insights from the exploratory analysis\n","\n","### Step 4: Ask & answer questions about the data\n","\n","- Ask at least 4 interesting questions about your dataset\n","- Answer the questions either by computing the results using Numpy/Pandas or by plotting graphs using Matplotlib/Seaborn\n","- Create new columns, merge multiple dataset and perform grouping/aggregation wherever necessary\n","- Wherever you're using a library function from Pandas/Numpy/Matplotlib etc. explain briefly what it does\n","\n","\n","### Step 5: Summarize your inferences & write a conclusion\n","\n","- Write a summary of what you've learned from the analysis\n","- Include interesting insights and graphs from previous sections\n","- Share ideas for future work on the same topic using other relevant datasets\n","- Share links to resources you found useful during your analysis\n","\n","\n","### Step 6: Make a submission & share your work\n","\n","- Upload your notebook to your Jovian.ml profile using `jovian.commit`.\n","- **Make a submission here**: https://jovian.ml/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas/assignment/course-project\n","- Share your work on the forum: https://jovian.ml/forum/t/course-project-on-exploratory-data-analysis-discuss-and-share-your-work/11684\n","- Browse through projects shared by other participants and give feedback\n","\n","\n","### (Optional) Step 7: Write a blog post\n","\n","- A blog post is a great way to present and showcase your work.  \n","- Sign up on [Medium.com](https://medium.com) to write a blog post for your project.\n","- Copy over the explanations from your Jupyter notebook into your blog post, and [embed code cells & outputs](https://medium.com/jovianml/share-and-embed-jupyter-notebooks-online-with-jovian-ml-df709a03064e)\n","- Check out the Jovian.ml Medium publication for inspiration:

This will run the notebook on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org), a free online service for running Jupyter notebooks. You can also select \"Run on Colab\" or \"Run on Kaggle\".\n","\n","\n","#### Option 2: Running on your computer locally\n","\n","1. Install Conda by [following these instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html). Add Conda binaries to your system `PATH`, so you can use the `conda` command on your terminal.\n","\n","2. Create a Conda environment and install the required libraries by running these commands on the terminal:\n","\n","```\n","conda create -n zerotopandas -y python=3.8\n","conda activate zerotopandas\n","pip install jovian jupyter numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn opendatasets --upgrade\n","```\n","\n","3. Press the \"Clone\" button above to copy the command for downloading the notebook, and run it on the terminal. This will create a new directory and download the notebook. The command will look something like this:\n","\n","```\n","jovian clone notebook-owner/notebook-id\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","4. Enter the newly created directory using `cd directory-name` and start the Jupyter notebook.\n","\n","```\n","jupyter notebook\n","```\n","\n","You can now access Jupyter's web interface by clicking the link that shows up on the terminal or by visiting http://localhost:8888 on your browser.
